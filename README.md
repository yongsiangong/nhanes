# NHANES Diabetes Prediction Model

This project leverages the NHANES dataset to develop predictive models for identifying diabetes. Utilizing features such as patient demographics, body measurements, and lab tests, we applied machine learning techniques to ascertain the likelihood of diabetes in individuals. 

The analysis involved preprocessing data, handling missing values, and employing one-hot encoding for categorical variables. Key models evaluated include Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest, with a focus on optimizing for recall to ensure sensitive detection of potential diabetic cases. The Random Forest model, which uses non-invasive data, showed the most balanced performance across various evaluation metrics and was selected as the best model for deployment. 

This project underscores the potential of machine learning in medical diagnostics and provides a foundation for further research to enhance predictive accuracy using non-invasive methods. The code and methodologies are documented in this repository, serving as a resource for healthcare analytics and machine learning applications.
